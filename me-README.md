# Setup
1. `npm install`
2. Now start debugging.
3. To trigger `activate` function, trigger command `Debug:Add Configuration`

# Note
1. the command `Debug:Add Configuration` is not from this extension
2. it is vscode default command
3. what this extension does is, add template into the commmand
4. I think lah, the `activate` function is just to push extension's functionality only
5. when you trigger vscode debug with type `bashdb`, only then it will trigger the extension's core function
